## Project Description

### Project #1: Mind Games
#### The project includes 5 mini games: 
- Parity Check - started by the ***'brain-event'*** command
##### *A random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer 'yes' if the number is even, or 'no' if it is odd.*
```
brain-event
```
- Calculator - started by the ***'brain-calc'*** command
##### *The user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.*
```
brain-calc
```
- GCD (greatest common divisor) - started by the ***'brain-gcd'*** command
##### *The user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 and 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.*
```
brain-gcd
```
- Arithmetic progression - started by the ***'brain-progression'*** command
##### *We show the player a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.*
```
brain-progression
```
- Prime number - started by the ***'brain-prime'*** command
##### *A random number is shown to the user. The user has to guess whether this number is prime.*
```
brain-prime
```
### To install package use: 
```
python3 -m pip install --user
```
